*Source*: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-certified-solutions-architect-professional-sap-c02/table-of-contents

The AWS Certified Solution Architect is divided into four key sections.

1. Design Solution for Organization Complexity (26% of the exam)

As part of Design Solution for Organization Complexity we will be covering connecting an on-premise network to an AWS Virtual Private Connection (VPC).

We will also be discussing multi-account organization and finally cost and usage, security and backup.

2. Design for New Solution (29% of the exam)

In the Design for New Solution, we will covering the AWS Well-Architected Framework which includes Operation Excellence (IaC and Configuration Management).

We will also cover reliability (failover and elasticity)

And finally, we will cover efficiency, sustainability and cost optimization. Which includes, serverless principles and event driven architecture.

3. Continous Improvement for Existing Solutions (25% of the exam)

On this section, we will cover measuring solutions. Including using Cloudwatch, the use of Lambda and Event Bridge, and security services.

4. Accelerate Workload Migration and Modernization (20% of the exam)

On this section, we will be covering the use of lifst and shift migration strategies as patterns. We will be looking individualized workloads, finding appropriate migration services and finding the best-fit solution for cloud.

In the following sections, we will have a product catagory, where we will go in deep for each AWS Services that is covered in the exam, as well, we will cover specific architecture and computer science requirements.
