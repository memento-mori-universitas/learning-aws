## Application Discovery Service

Is a way to audit your on-prem environment and figure out which servers are involved in a given application. The first step in to install the Application Discover Service agent on each of your on-premise servers.  While your on-premise application is still serving production, this agent works behind the scene to track traffic between servers and can help you determine which servers are involved in a given application. It then sends this data encrypted to the Application Discovery Service dashboard in the Migration Hub. It create a map of your application that you can use to visually understand which servers are involved in your application.
